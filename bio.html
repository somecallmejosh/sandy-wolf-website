    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>My desire to lead complete courses of therapy with individuals, families and couples led me to start a part time practice in 2001, and to hone my skills of engaging and facilitating people in making their lives better.</p>

      <p>Throughout my life I have always been fascinated by people's complexity, and how understanding and challenging the meaning beneath their behaviors can produce growth and change. At 17 years old, I decided that I wanted to be a part of that process. I received my undergraduate degree in Psychology at Clark University and my Master of Social Work at the University of Pennsylvania. Afterward, I returned to CT to complete a rigorous and rich fellowship at the Yale Psychiatric Institute working with adolescents and their families on its inpatient unit, which is when I discovered my love of and for learning, training and teaching clinical work.</p>
      <p>My subsequent workforce years were spent working with youth and families in various community mental health clinics, extended day programs, juvenile detention facilities and intensive outpatient facilities. I learned how to make assessments rapidly and in the context of multiple systems. It was through my work during these years that I learned how integral the role of cultural and larger systemic influences is on the health of an individual or a family.</p>
      <p>My desire to facilitate complete courses of therapy with individuals, families and couples led me to start a part time practice in 2001, and to hone my skills of engaging and facilitating people in making their lives better. Working this closely with people taught me the skills of listening for and correctly interpreting the meanings that underlie people's maladaptive habits and decisions that have resulted in their painful life struggles.These skills require an inherent belief in people's desire and capacity for change, and I work tirelessly to ensure that I maintain this ability to see and encourage their quest for health.</p>
      <p>Since 2013 I have worked solely in my psychotherapy practice, and am now channeling my lifelong passion for strengthening families into helping couples “on the brink” decide to save their marriage whenever possible, or to separate or divorce when it is not. In 2015 I became certified as a Divorce Mediator/Collaborative Professional in order to help divorcing couples recreate their families with integrity, respect and health.</p>
