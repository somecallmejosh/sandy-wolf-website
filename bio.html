    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>My desire to lead complete courses of therapy with individuals, families and couples led me to start a part time practice in 2001, and to hone my skills of engaging and facilitating people in making their lives better.</p>

      <p><strong>Throughout my life I have always been fascinated by people's complexity, and how understanding and challenging the meaning beneath their behaviors can produce growth and change</strong>. At 17 years old, I decided that I wanted to be a part of that process. I received my undergraduate degree in Psychology at Clark University and my Master of Social Work at the University of Pennsylvania. I returned to CT to complete a rigorous and rich fellowship at the Yale Psychiatric Institute working with adolescents and their families on its inpatient unit, which is when I discovered my love of and for learning, training and teaching clinical work.</p>

      <p>My subsequent workforce years were spent working with youth and families in various community mental health clinics, extended day programs, juvenile detention facilities and intensive outpatient facilities. I learned how to make assessments rapidly and in the context of multiple systems. It was through my work during these years that I learned the role of cultural and large systemic influences on the health of an individual or a family.</p>

      <p>My desire to lead complete courses of therapy with individuals, families and couples led me to start a part time practice in 2001, and to hone my skills of engaging and facilitating people in making their lives better. I began to understand that the greatest influence on how effective therapy would be for my clients is me—how well I listenand correctly interpret the underlying meaning of people's habits and decisions, my ability to bear and guide them through their pain, my belief in their desire and capacity for change. I work tirelessly to ensure that I remain as ethical and effective as possible.</p>

      <p>Since 2013 I have worked solely in my psychotherapy practice, and am now channeling my lifelong passion for strengthening families into helping couples “on the brink” decide to either save their marriage or to separate or divorce. In 2015 I became certified as a Divorce Mediator/Collaborative Professional in order to help divorcing couples recreate their families with integrity, respect and health.</p>
