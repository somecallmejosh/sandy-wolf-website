        <h2>Are you or your spouse considering divorce?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Have prior attempts at saving your marriage failed to make significant, lasting changes for the better?</li>
          <li>Do you feel as though you are on a roller coaster of hope and despair regarding your marriage?</li>
          <li>Are you worried that you could find yourself in the same position with future relationships if you did decide to leave your current one?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If so, Discernment Counseling could be your way off of that chaotic roller coaster and onto a path of clarity and confidence.</p>
        <p>Discernment Counseling is a new way of helping a specific type of couple that is usually unresponsive to traditional couples therapy--the "mixed agenda" couple, so named because each spouse has a different starting and ending point in mind. Discernment Counseling is a chance to slow down, take a breath, and look at your options for your marriage.</p>

        <h2>Is Discernment Counseling right for me?</h2>
        <h3>Discernment Counseling is best for:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>couples where one spouse feels clear that they want to save the marriage but the other spouse does not.</li>
          <li>Couples for whom traditional therapies have not worked in the past.</li>
          <li>Couples who feel dangerously stuck: staying feels unbearable, leaving impossible given the financial, emotional and logistical factors at stake.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How is Discernment Counseling different from other couples' therapies?</h2>
        <h3>Discernment Counseling is different in the following ways:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Length:</strong> short term (1-5 sessions) vs. open ended</li>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> the couple comes in together, but sessions are split into individual time with the counselor vs. sessions together</li>
        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> to deepen the couple's understanding of what has happened to their marriage and each spouse's own contributions to it vs. build skills, decrease conflict and improve the marriage</li>
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> not to save the marriage, but to see if it can be saved</li>
        </ul>
