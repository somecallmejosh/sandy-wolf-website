  <p>I help people who struggle with the "stuff of life"</p>
  <p>Do you find yourself making the same choices over and over again? Do you feel disappointed in the outcomes of your life?</p>
  <p>When you have exhausted every option to improve the quality of your relationships, work or mood with few results, you may find it helpful to talk to someone who is caring, interested and skilled. Speaking to someone with a fresh and nonjudgmental perspective can help you sort out and overcome the struggles of your life.</p>
  <p>I believe that all people inherently wish and are able to make positive changes in their lives. Unhelpful patterns stem from inaccurate or outdated ideas about who we are and what we are allowed to have in the world.I work with clients to explore and uncover those faulty beliefs, allowing them to become unstuck and to make healthier, more satisfying choices for themselves.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the origins of these faulty beliefs can stem from prior traumas or harmful family/cultural expectations or experiences. Whatever the source, correctly identifying and transforming those beliefs takes significant knowledge and skill. My 20 years of experience in working with clients of all ages and walks of life has shaped my ability to successfully engage clients in the important work of changing their lives for the better.</p>
  <p>I welcome the opportunity to work with people from midÂ­adolescence through adulthood who feel ready to learn to take better care of themselves and lean towards healing and health. Together we can work to create the richer, more meaningful and joyful life you have always wanted.</p>
